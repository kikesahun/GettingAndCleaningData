Description of variables:

The content of the downloaded files is stored in the following variables: x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test.
Datasets are merged in: x_data, y_data and subject_data.
features is the variable with the correct names for the x_data dataset

Description of source data:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up
are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Description of R script

Code is divided in the 5 steps required:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (already done within the previous steps).
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
